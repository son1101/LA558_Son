<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
<h3>Leaflet Map with Markers</h3>
This map shows the locations I visited for field trips when I attended Korea University. I made a CSV file including each location's longitude and longitude. 
  I created a map with custom book icons on it. In addition, I added a control to select fromone of five base maps - OSM, Aerial, TopoMap, Terrain, MainRoad. 
  Lastly, I made pop ups showing the location name and the type of the site and applied cluster funtion.

<h3>Leaflet Choropleth Map</h3>
The interactive map shows the proportion of Black K-12 students in each Iowa county, with pop-ups displaying county names and corresponding percentages. 
  The legend is located on the bottom right of the map for reference. 
  Additionally, a toggle button has been added to the top left of the map to indicate the location of Iowa State University. 
  (The toggle button was added as an application of the knowledge gained from lectures and personal study.)
