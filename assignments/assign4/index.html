<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
<h3>1. Leaflet Map with Markers</h3>
The map below displays the various locations I visited during my field trips while studying at Korea University. <br>
  To create this map, I made a CSV file containing the longitude and latitude of each location.<br>
 I added custom book icons that represented each site. <br>
  Additionally, I included a control that allows users to select from one of five base maps: OSM, Aerial, TopoMap, Terrain, and MainRoad.<br>
To provide more information about each location, I added pop-ups that display the name of the site and its type. <br>
  Finally, to ensure optimal functionality, I applied a cluster function to the map.

<h3>2. Leaflet Choropleth Map</h3>
The interactive map shows the proportion of Black K-12 students in each Iowa county, <br>
  with pop-ups displaying county names and corresponding percentages. <br>
  The legend is located on the bottom right of the map for reference. <br>
  Additionally, a toggle button has been added to the top left of the map to indicate the location of Iowa State University. <br>
  (The toggle button was added as an application of the knowledge gained from lectures and personal study.)
