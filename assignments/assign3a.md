  - First, three data sets were obtained:
    - The map of Seoul (SHP File) provided by the National Geographic Information Institute (South Korea)
    - Population of the districts in Seoul as of 2002 **and** 2022 (CSV Files) provided by Seoul Metropolitan Government
  - The data sets were table-joined through the "Join" tool, and then population growth rates were calculated through the "Calculate Field" tool in QGIS.
