## Assignment 3a

### [1. OpenStreetMap](https://son1101.github.io/LA558_Son/assignments/assign3a/assign3a.html) shows my hometown in Seoul, South Korea.




### <a href="assign3a/assign3.pdf" target="_blank">2. Geosptial PDF</a> and [3. GIS2Web](https://son1101.github.io/LA558_Son/assignments/assign3a/qgis2web_Assign3a/index.html) show Population Growth Rates of the Districts in Seoul, South Korea between 2002 and 2022.

#### (Description)
- To make a choropleth map, I used three sources:
  - The map of Seoul (SHP File) provided by National Geographic Information Institute (South Korea)
  - Population of the districts in Seoul as of 2002 and 2022 (CSV File) provided by Seoul Metropolitan Governmet
- The three data sets were joined and population growth rates were calculated through "Calculate Field" tool in QGIS.
