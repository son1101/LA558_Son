- Description:
  - For choropleth maps, three sources were used:
    - The map of Seoul (SHP File) provided by the National Geographic Information Institute (South Korea)
    - Population of the districts in Seoul as of 2002 **and** 2022 (CSV File) provided by Seoul Metropolitan Government
  - The three data sets were joined, and then population growth rates were calculated through the "Calculate Field" tool in QGIS.
